Data Set Description


Udacity dataset ‘baseball_data.csv‘ was used for this project.
This dataset initially contained 1,157 baseball players. After the first look at the numbers and making histograms to see distributions of values I noticed, that there were 266 players with Avg = 0. It is difficult for a player to have this score if he was playing. It is even more difficult to have 23% of players to play that bad.
I came to conclusion that these players most probably were not playing. So I decided to delete their records from the database, because they do not represent the real performance of these players and will bring us to wrong results.
New database without these players is named ‘baseball_data_new.csv’ and it contains 891 baseball players.
